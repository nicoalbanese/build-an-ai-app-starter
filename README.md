# Next.js + PostgreSQL Auth Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit that uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for simple email + password login, [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) as the ORM, and a [Neon Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) database to persist the data.
